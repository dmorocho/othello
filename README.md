# Reversi/Othello with Obstacles

## Pursuit Holiday Hackathon

We created a web app game that functions the same as Reversi but with our own creative take on the original game. You are allowed to play the original game as well if you desire.

## Developer Setup

This project is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd othello
```

2. Install dependencies:

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash

This will start the application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Other Available Scripts
